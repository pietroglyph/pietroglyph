I like computer vision, controls engineering, and math.

Many of my previous projects involved writing controls and computer vision code for the students that participate in the *FIRST* Robotics Competition and *FIRST* Tech Challenge. I've contributed a lot to [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) and [PhotonVision](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/) in particular.

 <summary>Some of my projects</summary>
 
 ### *2020*
  - GPU-accelerated PhotonVision, a computer vision tool for FRC, the Raspberry Pi using OpenGL and MMAL ([C++](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photon-picam-driver))
  - Wrote an extended and unscented Kalman filter from scratch and contributed them to a library used by most FRC teams called WPILib ([C++/Java](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/commit/3b283ab9aaf9d23d7870b9c3723d03760a0bd378))
  - Designed and implemented a music matching algorithim (like Shazam) using the fast Fourier transform and principal component analysis (MATLAB)
  - Wrote an Android wrapper for the Intel RealSense T265 camera that's used by teams in the *FIRST* Tech Challenge ([C++/Java](https://github.com/pietroglyph/ftc265))
  - Completely redesigned the user interface of PhotonVision using Vue.js and Vuetify ([JS](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/tree/v2021.1.3/photon-client), [demo](https://demo.photonvision.org/))

 ### *2019*
  - Worked on the GUI rework of a popular robot system identification tool for FRC that's part of WPILib ([Python](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/frc-characterization))
  - Wrote a differential drive robot trajectory generator in Java and presented on how it works to over fifty students ([Java](https://github.com/Spartronics4915/SpartronicsLib), [animated presentation](https://github.com/pietroglyph/trajectory-presentation))

 ### *2017/18*
  - Wrote a webapp that allows students to edit and deploy robot code written with WPILib to a real robot ([Go/TypeScript](https://github.com/pietroglyph/learnyouarobot))
  - Wrote the microcontroller client and server code for an IoT product that tracks the Washington state ferry boats ([C++/JS](https://github.com/pietroglyph/fow))
